                            "question": "What does market capitalization represent?",

                            "correct": 1,
                            "explanation": "Market capitalization, often called 'market cap', is calculated by multiplying a company's current stock price by its total number of outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and trades at $50 per share, its market cap would be $50 million. This represents the total market value of all the company's shares and is used to categorize companies into different sizes:\n\n- Large-cap: Usually above $10 billion\n- Mid-cap: Between $2 billion and $10 billion\n- Small-cap: Below $2 billion\n\nMarket cap is important because it:\n1. Indicates company size and stability\n2. Helps in portfolio diversification\n3. Reflects growth potential and risk level\n4. Used in index inclusion criteria"

                            "explanation": "Market makers are crucial to the efficient functioning of financial markets. Their primary role is to maintain liquidity by:\n\n1. Always being ready to buy or sell securities\n2. Maintaining an inventory of stocks\n3. Quoting both buy (bid) and sell (ask) prices\n4. Profiting from the spread between bid and ask prices\n\nExample: If you want to buy 100 shares of a less frequently traded stock, without market makers, you might have to wait hours or days to find a seller. Market makers solve this by:\n- Buying from sellers even when there's no immediate buyer\n- Selling to buyers even when there's no immediate seller\n- Adjusting prices to maintain balanced inventory\n\nThis service ensures:\n- Immediate trade execution\n- Price continuity\n- Market efficiency"
