Understanding Risk Tolerance\n   - Assess your financial goals\n   - Consider your time horizon\n   - Evaluate emotional comfort with volatility\n\n2. Portfolio Rebalancing\n   - Regular portfolio review (quarterly/annually)\n   - Maintaining target asset allocation\n   - Adjusting for market changes\n\n3.
